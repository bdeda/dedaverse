Dedaverse
===========================

Dedaverse is an asset system for managing the components of visual media projects, films, and games.


# Focus on Art, not on Tech

Development of visual content for various media is developed using some standard practices across 
various project types. The Dedaverse helps streamline those standards while making workflows easier 
for artists to iterate on the art, and not be burdened by the technical details of the workflow. 


## The Tech

Built with Python, the Dedaverse provides tooling to store and track the development process of an asset from concept to completion. 
Users can brainstorm ideas before committing to an idea for an asset. Once ideas pass through gated checkpoints of developemnt, they 
are transformed into more production-defined models of data for that asset, linking tasks from task management systems like Jira to 
the concrete deliverable of that asset.

The Dedaverse allows the user to configure various plugins for the system to interact with file management and revision management systems. 
One example is our Perforce plugin. This uses Perforce on the back end to handle the versioning and sharing of the project assets, while 
exposing a limited interface to that system as to allow the artists to focus on the artwork, and not be overwhelmed with the technical 
implementation details.
