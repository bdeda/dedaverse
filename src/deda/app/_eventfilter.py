"""This is the event filter class that handles the drag and mouse move events for the DCCs that are dedaverse enabled.

The goal of this event filter is to catch when a dedaverse object is dragged and dropped into a DCC application. It will
be up to the DCC plugin to provide a handler for the drag/drop events and do any DCC sepecific logic to handle the object.
